# Angular Microfrontends with Native Federation

This is a study project demonstrating how to build Micro Frontends using **Angular 20** and the **@angular-architects/native-federation** module federation plugin.

The project is structured into:
- A **Shell** application that serves as the host
- Two **Remote** applications (first-mf and second-mf)

Each remote is independently deployable and consumed by the shell using module federation.

## 🔧 Technologies

- Angular 20
- @angular-architects/native-federation
- Webpack 5 Module Federation

## 🚀 Getting Started

After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, you can run all applications with a single command:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment 😁
